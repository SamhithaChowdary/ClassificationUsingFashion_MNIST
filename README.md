## ClassificationUsingFashion_MNIST
I have done this kaggle competition with Sravani Subraveti

In this, we are given the Fashion MNIST Dataset published by The Zalandoâ€™s article consists of (60000,784) training data and (10000,784) testing data. Each sample is 28x28 gray-scale image associated with a label from 5 classes. The problem statement here is to classify the dataset and predict the labels of test dataset based on the train data.

In the first part, we used Feature extraction methods like PCA, LDA methods to reduce the dimensions of the large dataset which has 784 columns in both train and test dataset. After applying the dimentionality reduction techniques we applied classical classification techniques to the reduced data set obtained. We used classical methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest(RF), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC).
